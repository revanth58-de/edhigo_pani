## 🧪 API Testing Checklist

Open a new PowerShell terminal and test backend endpoints:

### Auth Endpoints
```powershell
# Test send OTP
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/auth/send-otp" -Method POST -Body (@{phone="+919876543210"} | ConvertTo-Json) -ContentType "application/json"

# Should return: { success: true, otp: "1234" }

```powershell
# Get jobs
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/jobs" -Method GET
```

### Health Check

## 🚀 Quick Testing Tips

2. **Watch Both Terminals**: Keep backend and Expo terminals visible
3. **Use Expo Dev Menu**: Shake phone → "Reload" if something breaks
4. **Clear Cache if Needed**: `npx expo start --clear`
5. **Test on Real Data**: Use actual phone numbers during testing
6. **Check Network Tab**: In Expo dev tools, monitor API calls

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### App Crashes
1. Check Expo terminal for error stack trace
2. Look for red error screen on device
3. Reload app (shake → reload)

### Screen Doesn't Load
1. Check import in `AppNavigator.js`
2. Verify screen is added to correct navigator
3. Check for syntax errors in screen file

### API Call Fails
1. Confirm backend running on port 5000
2. Check API URL in `config/api.config.js`
3. Verify endpoint exists in backend
4. Check request payload format

### Navigation Doesn't Work
1. Verify screen name matches in navigator
2. Check navigation params are passed correctly
3. Ensure stack navigator includes the target screen

2. ✅ UI renders completely
3. ✅ User interactions respond
4. ✅ API calls succeed (if applicable)
5. ✅ Navigation works correctly
6. ✅ No console errors or warnings
7. ✅ Data displays correctly
