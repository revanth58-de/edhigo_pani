## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What if I lose internet/GPS?**
A: The app stores the last known state. Attendance requires an active connection at the moment of scanning, but tracking works offline and syncs later.

**Q: Can I change my role?**
A: Yes, logout and re-verify your phone number to select a different role for the new session.

**Q: How are payments handled?**
A: The app calculates the amount. Actual money transfer happens via UPI apps (PhonePe/GPay) or Cash, recorded manually in the app for receipt generation.
